EyeCube also envisions improving the road maintenance framework by addressing problems in real-time and bridging the communication gap during the entire process of road maintenance work. The solution is a modular intelligent device that can be mounted on any vehicle's dashboard. It consists of a hardware unit installed on vehicles traveling on highways, which makes them a part of a swarm of agents traveling across a network of highways - feeding real-time road damage data with geotags. The hardware consists of a camera that faces the road and onboard software utilizes neural networks to compute - road damage, type of road damage, and the GPS location of the road damage. The detected road damage is computed based on a large dataset of images and retrains the system on-the-go with every damage detection.

EyeCUBE serves as a single solution for driving customer engagement on highways and highway road safety by AI-enabled cloud services.
